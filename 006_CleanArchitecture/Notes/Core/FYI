Core packages includes packages:
    Domain      == Entities
    Application == UseCases

Domain contains Entities

Application - interfaces. 
    Initiall only NoteEditor interface was created. 
    However futher another editors maight be needed.
    So proactivelly a general Editor inteface was created.

    As agurments Editor uses abstract <T, TId> - to be used for specific interfaces.

    Specific inteface NoteEditor implements Editor, 
    and instead of <T, TId> uses specific agruments <Note, Integer>
    Such sintacsis allows not to override methods in NoteEditor
    onle specific to Note method was added - PrintAll  

    Then ConcreteNoteEditor implements NoteEditor 
    and overrides methods of all Editor and NoteEdior 
    with correct arguments.
    
    Inteface NotesDatabaseContext - inteface to interract with Database.
    Describes 2 general methods geting all records and saving changes made.
    NotesDatabaseContext won't be implemented but
    it will be given to the ConcreteNoteEditor as field and initiated via Constructor.
    And then all methods will work with this context.
